## Present
- I am missing some papers in review part
- rewriting review part more fluently
- defintions of some technical words missing

## Questions Paper Review

- Exclusion Criteria
- Is the overall direction correct?
- Are there too many CL methods?

## SMA data

- What to proof?
- anomalies ?

## Notes
- anomalies does not have to be completely novel
is that model capable of another input data
- tasks in our scenarios are different inverters in different locations
    - STL: trained and tested on the same inverter
    - MTL: trained and tested on all inverters
    - ZSL: trained on a subset on inverters and tested on completely new ones
- the location of the inverters is different and thats the zero shot learning scenario
