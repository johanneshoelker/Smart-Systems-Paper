\section{Implementation}\label{implementation}
The best fitting strategies are implemented on a small test data set in order to demonstrate how it works: Proof of Concept\\
\subsection{Data Set}
In the test data the learning data is seperate from the data including anomalies. The important thing about Zero Shot Learning is that a specific anomaly never occured like this before. In the test data, all chosen representation learning techniques are applied using the same data for learning and afterwards testing the anomaly detection with the same anomalies. According to chapter (Evaluation) the characteristics are evaluated for each rl technique.\\

\subsection{Results}
