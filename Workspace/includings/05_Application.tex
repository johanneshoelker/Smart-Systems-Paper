\section{Application on Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series}\label{application}
The found articles are filtered using the exclusion criteria defined in chapter \ref{criteria}. By excluding methods that haven't been tested with multiple input variables we answer RQ2. Methods that are not tested in Zero-Shot Learning Scenarios are also excluded which covers RQ4.  In order to achieve a successful implementation in the following chapter only models which are publicly available and well documented are chosen for further examination.

More precisely we want to know by the defined filter process which of the proposed RL types are best suited for Zero Shot Anomaly Detection in multi-variate time series data. A selection of appropriate methods for Time Series Data Anomaly Detection out of \ref{review} is extracted.

 % table
All found representation learning methodologies from chapter \ref{review} are listed in table \ref{tab_rl_methods}. Their evaluation on the exclusion criteria is marked and a short description on the underlying concepts is given.
