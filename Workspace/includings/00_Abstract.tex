  The detection of anomalies in time series data is subject of current research in machine learning. Several methods are published in the past 3 years which try to detect anomalies in various ways. Mostly the patterns that represent time series are learned. This is particularly useful for a general knowledge about the data. The concepts used for this include CNNs, Contrastive Learning, Autoencoders and Transformers. This paper provides an overview of the recent developments in anomaly detection and presents methods that try to detect anomalies in time series data. The found methods are evaluated with regard to the adaptability on other tasks than they trained for and to multivariate input. 
  Methods that are publicly available are investigated further using a completely new dataset with known anomalies provided by SMA. A proof of work on a Zero-Shot scenario without training the models is presented. None of the methods found the correct time point of an anomaly.
