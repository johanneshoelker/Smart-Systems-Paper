\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
\subsection{Discussion}
The presented paper has a few limitations which are discussed in this section.

% Zero-Shot Limitation
That the methods are not tested on Zero-Shot Scenarios in the paper they are presented doesn't mean they can not perform well on them.  Further research and test with the most promising models need to be done in the future.

% Multivariate Limitations
That is not the case for multivariate data. If a method designed for time series data with a single input variable needs to be used for multiple input variables a redesign is necessary. This can be extensive or rather simple depending on the architecture. To know how much redesign is necessary every method has to be reviewed in further research.


The transferability between time series datasets is difficult due to the fact that the data between domains is huge \shortcite{ma_survey_2023}

\subsection{Future Work}
This section presents ideas for further research.

% Limitations on implementation
The implemention is done without further analysis of the results. The correctness of the detection can be rated and compared.

%
Not only the methods available as open source should be implemented and tested. Methods without a code example provided by the authors can be implemented based on the architecture presented in the paper.
