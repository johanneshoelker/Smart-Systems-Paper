	abstract = {Multivariate time series (MTS) data are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in networked systems, e.g., IoT systems and 5G networks. Anomaly detection in MTS refers to identifying time series which exhibit different behaviors from normal status. Building such a system, however, is challenging due to a few reasons: i) labels for anomaly cases are usually unavailable or very rare; ii) most existing approaches rely on manual model-design and hyperparameter tuning, which may cost a huge amount of labor effort. To this end, we propose an autonomous anomaly detection technique for multivariate time series data (TimeAutoAD) based on a novel self-supervised contrastive loss. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst present an automatic anomaly detection pipeline to optimize the model conﬁguration and hyperparameters automatically. Next, we introduce three different strategies to augment the training data for generating pseudo negative time series and employ a self-supervised contrastive loss to distinguish the original time series and the generated time series. In this way, the representation learning capability of TimeAutoAD can be greatly enhanced and the anomaly detection performance can thus be improved. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed TimeAutoAD not only outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches but also exhibits robustness when training data are contaminated.},

	abstract = {Time series anomaly detection in industrial processes has recently attracted attention. However, since there are no labels in the manufacturing process data collected in real time, there are limitations in using supervised learning-based classification models. Therefore, the proposed method newly defines an objective function that simultaneously learns the OCC model and contrastive learning. In addition, by applying data augmentation techniques suitable for periodic time series data in contrastive learning, feature extraction that preserves temporal characteristics is possible. The effectiveness of representation extraction was verified by showing high anomaly detection performance even in datasets with similar normal and anomaly data forms.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection has gained increasing attention in recent years, but detecting anomalies in time series data remains challenging due to temporal dynamics, label scarcity, and data diversity in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method for anomaly detection in time series data, called CL-TAD (Contrastive-Learning-based method for Times series Anomaly Detection), which employs a contrastive-learning-based representation learning technique. Inspired by the successes of reconstruction-based approaches and contrastive learning approaches, the proposed method seeks to leverage these approaches for time series anomaly detection. The CL-TAD method is comprised of two main components: positive sample generation and contrastivelearning-based representation learning. The former component generates positive samples by trying to reconstruct the original data from masked samples. These positive samples, in conjunction with the original data, serve as input for the contrastive-learning-based representation learning component. The representations of input original data and their masked data are used to detect anomalies later on. Experimental results have demonstrated that the CL-TAD method achieved the best performance on ﬁve datasets out of nine benchmark datasets over 10 other recent methods. By leveraging the reconstruction learning and contrastive learning techniques, our method offers a promising solution for effectively detecting anomalies in time series data by handling the issues raised by label scarcity and data diversity, delivering high performance.},

	abstract = {Industry devices (i.e., entities) such as server machines, spacecrafts, engines, etc., are typically monitored with multivariate time series, whose anomaly detection is critical for an entity’s service quality management. However, due to the complex temporal dependence and stochasticity of multivariate time series, their anomaly detection remains a big challenge. This paper proposes OmniAnomaly, a stochastic recurrent neural network for multivariate time series anomaly detection that works well robustly for various devices. Its core idea is to capture the normal patterns of multivariate time series by learning their robust representations with key techniques such as stochastic variable connection and planar normalizing flow, reconstruct input data by the representations, and use the reconstruction probabilities to determine anomalies. Moreover, for a detected entity anomaly, OmniAnomaly can provide interpretations based on the reconstruction probabilities of its constituent univariate time series. The evaluation experiments are conducted on two public datasets from aerospace and a new server machine dataset (collected and released by us) from an Internet company. OmniAnomaly achieves an overall F1-Score of 0.86 in three real-world datasets, significantly outperforming the best performing baseline method by 0.09. The interpretation accuracy for OmniAnomaly is up to 0.89.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03639},
	abstract = {Anomaly detection in multi-variate time series (MVTS) data is a huge challenge as it requires simultaneous representation of long term temporal dependencies and correlations across multiple variables. More often, this is solved by breaking the complexity through modeling one dependency at a time. In this paper, we propose a Time-series Representational Learning through Contrastive Predictive Coding (TRL-CPC) towards anomaly detection in MVTS data. First, we jointly optimize an encoder, an auto-regressor and a non-linear transformation function to effectively learn the representations of the MVTS data sets, for predicting future trends. It must be noted that the context vectors are representative of the observation window in the MTVS. Next, the latent representations for the succeeding instants obtained through non-linear transformations of these context vectors, are contrasted with the latent representations of the encoder for the multi-variables such that the density for the positive pair is maximized. Thus, the TRL-CPC helps to model the temporal dependencies and the correlations of the parameters for a healthy signal pattern. Finally, ﬁtting the latent representations are ﬁt into a Gaussian scoring function to detect anomalies. Evaluation of the proposed TRL-CPC on three MVTS data sets against SOTA anomaly detection methods shows the superiority of TRL-CPC.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection suffers from unbalanced data since anomalies are quite rare. Synthetically generated anomalies are a solution to such ill or not fully deﬁned data. However, synthesis requires an expressive representation to guarantee the quality of the generated data. In this article, we propose a two-level hierarchical latent space representation that distills inliers’ feature descriptors [through autoencoders (AEs)] into more robust representations based on a variational family of distributions (through a variational AE) for zero-shot anomaly generation. From the learned latent distributions, we select those that lie on the outskirts of the training data as synthetic-outlier generators. Also, we synthesize from them, i.e., generate negative samples without seen them before, to train binary classiﬁers. We found that the use of the proposed hierarchical structure for feature distillation and fusion creates robust and general representations that allow us to synthesize pseudo outlier samples. Also, in turn, train robust binary classiﬁers for true outlier detection (without the need for actual outliers during training). We demonstrate the performance of our proposal on several benchmarks for anomaly detection.},

Then, we give an overview of TS-PTMs according to the pre-training techniques. The main categories we explore include supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised TS-PTMs. Further, extensive experiments are conducted to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of transfer learning strategies, Transformer-based models, and representative TS-PTMs. Finally, we point out some potential directions of TS-PTMs for future work.
