	abstract = {Detecting anomalous subsequences in time series data is an important task in areas ranging from manufacturing processes over finance applications to health care monitoring. An anomaly can indicate important events, such as production faults, delivery bottlenecks, system defects, or heart flicker, and is therefore of central interest. Because time series are often large and exhibit complex patterns, data scientists have developed various specialized algorithms for the automatic detection of such anomalous patterns. The number and variety of anomaly detection algorithms has grown significantly in the past and, because many of these solutions have been developed independently and by different research communities, there is no comprehensive study that systematically evaluates and compares the different approaches. For this reason, choosing the best detection technique for a given anomaly detection task is a difficult challenge.},

	abstract = {Real-time lightweight time series anomaly detection has become increasingly crucial in cybersecurity and many other domains. Its ability to adapt to unforeseen pattern changes and swiftly identify anomalies enables prompt responses and critical decision-making. While several such anomaly detection approaches have been introduced in recent years, they primarily utilize a single type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and have been implemented in only one deep learning framework. It is unclear how the use of different types of RNNs available in various deep learning frameworks affects the performance of these anomaly detection approaches due to the absence of comprehensive evaluations. Arbitrarily choosing a RNN variant and a deep learning framework to implement an anomaly detection approach may not reflect its true performance and could potentially mislead users into favoring one approach over another. In this paper, we aim to study the influence of various types of RNNs available in popular deep learning frameworks on real-time lightweight time series anomaly detection. We reviewed several state-of-the-art approaches and implemented a representative anomaly detection approach using well-known RNN variants supported by three widely recognized deep learning frameworks. A comprehensive evaluation is then conducted to analyze the performance of each implementation across real-world, open-source time series datasets. The evaluation results provide valuable guidance for selecting the appropriate RNN variant and deep learning framework for real-time, lightweight time series anomaly detection.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an extensive empirical study on the integration of dimensionality reduction techniques with advanced unsupervised time series anomaly detection models, focusing on the MUTANT and Anomaly-Transformer models. The study involves a comprehensive evaluation across three different datasets: MSL, SMAP, and SWaT. Each dataset poses unique challenges, allowing for a robust assessment of the models’ capabilities in varied contexts. The dimensionality reduction techniques examined include PCA, UMAP, Random Projection, and t-SNE, each offering distinct advantages in simplifying highdimensional data. Our findings reveal that dimensionality reduction not only aids in reducing computational complexity but also significantly enhances anomaly detection performance in certain scenarios. Moreover, a remarkable reduction in training times was observed, with reductions by approximately 300\% and 650\% when dimensionality was halved and minimized to the lowest dimensions, respectively. This efficiency gain underscores the dual benefit of dimensionality reduction in both performance enhancement and operational efficiency. The MUTANT model exhibits notable adaptability, especially with UMAP reduction, while the Anomaly-Transformer demonstrates versatility across various reduction techniques. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the synergistic effects of dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection, contributing valuable perspectives to the field of time series analysis. The study underscores the importance of selecting appropriate dimensionality reduction strategies based on specific model requirements and dataset characteristics, paving the way for more efficient, accurate, and scalable solutions in anomaly detection.},

	abstract = {Several techniques for multivariate time series anomaly detection have been proposed recently, but a systematic comparison on a common set of datasets and metrics is lacking. This article presents a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of unsupervised and semisupervised deep-learning-based methods for anomaly detection and diagnosis on multivariate time series data from cyberphysical systems. Unlike previous works, we vary the model and post-processing of model errors, i.e., the scoring functions independently of each other, through a grid of ten models and four scoring functions, comparing these variants to state-of-the-art methods. In time-series anomaly detection, detecting anomalous events is more important than detecting individual anomalous time points. Through experiments, we ﬁnd that the existing evaluation metrics either do not take events into account or cannot distinguish between a good detector and trivial detectors, such as a random or an all-positive detector. We propose a new metric to overcome these drawbacks, namely, the composite F-score (Fc1), for evaluating time-series anomaly detection. Our study highlights that dynamic scoring functions work much better than static ones for multivariate time series anomaly detection, and the choice of scoring functions often matters more than the choice of the underlying model. We also ﬁnd that a simple, channel-wise model—the univariate fully connected auto-encoder, with the dynamic Gaussian scoring function emerges as a winning candidate for both anomaly detection and diagnosis, beating state-of-the-art algorithms.},

	abstract = {In recent years, due to the frequent occurrence of network intrusions, more and more researchers have begun to focus on network intrusion detection. However, it is still a challenge to detect unknown attacks. Currently, there are two main methods of unknown attack detection: clustering and honeypot. But they still have unsolved problems such as difﬁculty in collecting unknown attack samples and failure to detect on time. Zero-Shot learning is proposed to deal with the problem in this article, which can recognize unknown attacks by learning the mapping relations between feature space and semantic space (such as attribute space). When the semantic descriptions of all attacks (including known and unknown attacks) are provided, the classiﬁer built by Zero-Shot learning can extract common semantic information among all attacks and construct connections between known and unknown attacks. The classiﬁer then utilizes the connections to classify unknown attacks although there are no samples for unknown attacks. In this article, we ﬁrst propose to use Zero-Shot learning to overcome the challenge of unknown attack detection and illustrate the feasibility of this method. Secondly, we then propose a novel method of Zero-Shot learning based on sparse autoencoder for unknown attack detection. This method maps the feature of known attacks to the semantic space, and restores the semantic space to the feature space by constrains of reconstruction error, and establishes the feature to semantic mapping, which is used to detect unknown attacks. Veriﬁcation tests have been carried out by using the public dataset NSL\_KDD. From the experiments conducted in this work, the results show that the average accuracy reaches 88.3\%, which performs better than other methods.},

At present, the deep learning method based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) has emerged for time series anomaly detection. However, this method needs to ﬁnd the best mapping from real-time space to the latent space at the anomaly detection stage, which brings new errors and takes a long time. In this paper, we propose a long short-term memory-based variational autoencoder generation adversarial networks (LSTM-based VAE-GAN) method for time series anomaly detection, which eﬀectively solves the above problems. Our method jointly trains the encoder, the generator and the discriminator to take advantage of the mapping ability of the encoder and the discrimination ability of the discriminator simultaneously. The long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are used as the encoder, the generator and the discriminator. At the anomaly detection stage, anomalies are detected based on reconstruction diﬀerence and discrimination results.

	abstract = {Multivariate time series data come as a collection of time series describing different aspects of a certain temporal phenomenon. Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.},

	abstract = {Engineers at eBay utilize robust methods in monitoring IT system signals for anomalies. However, the growing scale of signals, both in volumes and dimensions, overpowers traditional statistical state-space or supervised learning tools. Thus, state-of-the-art methods based on unsupervised deep learning are sought in recent research. However, we experienced flaws when implementing those methods, such as requiring partial supervision and weaknesses to high dimensional datasets, among other reasons discussed in this paper. We propose a practical approach for inferring anomalies from large multivariate sets. We observe an abundance of time series in real-world applications, which exhibit asynchronous and consistent repetitive variations, such as IT, weather, utility, and transportation. Our solution is designed to leverage this behavior. The solution utilizes spectral analysis on the latent representation of a pre-trained autoencoder to extract dominant frequencies across the signals, which are then used in a subsequent network that learns the phase shifts across the signals and produces a synchronized representation of the raw multivariate. Random subsets of the synchronous multivariate are then fed into an array of autoencoders learning to minimize the quantile reconstruction losses, which are then used to infer and localize anomalies based on a majority vote. We benchmark this method against state-of-the-art approaches on public datasets and eBay’s data using their referenced evaluation methods. Furthermore, we address the limitations of the referenced evaluation methods and propose a more realistic evaluation method.},

	abstract = {Efficient anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate timeseries data is of great importance for modern industrial applications. However, building a system that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations is a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data volatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications. Despite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly detection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this paper, we propose TranAD, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection and diagnosis model which uses attentionbased sequence encoders to swiftly perform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the data. TranAD uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust multi-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability. Additionally, model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) allows us to train the model using limited data. Extensive empirical studies on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that TranAD can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods in detection and diagnosis performance with data and time-efficient training. Specifically, TranAD increases F1 scores by up to 17\%, reducing training times by up to 99\% compared to the baselines.},

Due to the intricate temporal dependencies within time series data and the difficulty in obtaining labeled data, recent anomaly detection methods have primarily focused on the temporal domain features of time series data, neglecting the frequency domain features. However, spectral analysis can better utilize periodic information within time series data such as seasonal patterns, which helps capturing multiscale and multiple frequency features. In this paper, we present a Fourier Time Series Transformer model (FTST for short), which combines the features of both time and frequency domains for time series anomaly detection. Specifically, the attention mechanism is utilized for modeling the temporal domain, while the Fourier Transform is employed to transform time series data into frequency domain data. The frequency domain features are then modeled using a Temporal Convolutional Network. By making full use of the temporal and frequency domains of time series data, FTST can significantly enhance the performance of time series anomaly detection.

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential in long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning. In this paper, we study the problem of using LLMs to detect tabular anomalies and show that pre-trained LLMs are zeroshot batch-level anomaly detectors. That is, without extra distribution-specific model fitting, they can discover hidden outliers in a batch of data, demonstrating their ability to identify low-density data regions. For LLMs that are not well aligned with anomaly detection and frequently output factual errors, we apply simple yet effective datagenerating processes to simulate synthetic batchlevel anomaly detection datasets and propose an end-to-end fine-tuning strategy to bring out the potential of LLMs in detecting real anomalies. Experiments on a large anomaly detection benchmark (ODDS) showcase i) GPT-4 has on-par performance with the state-of-the-art transductive learning-based anomaly detection methods and ii) the efficacy of our synthetic dataset and fine-tuning strategy in aligning LLMs to this task.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection requires detecting abnormal samples in large unlabeled datasets. While progress in deep learning and the advent of foundation models has produced powerful zero-shot anomaly detection methods, their deployment in practice is often hindered by the lack of labeled data—without it, their detection performance cannot be evaluated reliably. In this work, we propose SWSA (Selection With Synthetic Anomalies): a general-purpose framework to select image-based anomaly detectors with a generated synthetic validation set. Our proposed anomaly generation method assumes access to only a small support set of normal images and requires no training or finetuning. Once generated, our synthetic validation set is used to create detection tasks that compose a validation framework for model selection. In an empirical study, we find that SWSA often selects models that match selections made with a groundtruth validation set, resulting in higher AUROCs than baseline methods. We also find that SWSA selects prompts for CLIP-based anomaly detection that outperform baseline prompt selection strategies on all datasets, including the challenging MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.},

	abstract = {Research on unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) has recently progressed, significantly increasing detection accuracy. This paper focuses on texture images and considers how few normal samples are needed for accurate AD. We first highlight the critical nature of the problem that previous studies have overlooked: accurate detection gets harder for anisotropic textures when image orientations are not aligned between inputs and normal samples. We then propose a zero-shot method, which detects anomalies without using a normal sample. The method is free from the issue of unaligned orientation between input and normal images. It assumes the input texture to be homogeneous, detecting image regions that break the homogeneity as anomalies. We present a quantitative criterion to judge whether this assumption holds for an input texture. Experimental results show the broad applicability of the proposed zero-shot method and its good performance comparable to or even higher than the state-of-the-art methods using hundreds of normal samples.

	abstract = {Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) requires detection models trained using auxiliary data to detect anomalies without any training sample in a target dataset. It is a crucial task when training data is not accessible due to various concerns, e.g., data privacy, yet it is challenging since the models need to generalize to anomalies across different domains where the appearance of foreground objects, abnormal regions, and background features, such as defects/tumors on different products/organs, can vary significantly. Recently large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong zero-shot recognition ability in various vision tasks, including anomaly detection. However, their ZSAD performance is weak since the VLMs focus more on modeling the class semantics of the foreground objects rather than the abnormality/normality in the images. In this paper we introduce a novel approach, namely AnomalyCLIP, to adapt CLIP for accurate ZSAD across different domains. The key insight of AnomalyCLIP is to learn object-agnostic text prompts that capture generic normality and abnormality in an image regardless of its foreground objects. This allows our model to focus on the abnormal image regions rather than the object semantics, enabling generalized normality and abnormality recognition on diverse types of objects. Large-scale experiments on 17 real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AnomalyCLIP achieves superior zero-shot performance of detecting and segmenting anomalies in datasets of highly diverse class semantics from various defect inspection and medical imaging domains.

	abstract = {Multivariate time series (MTS) data are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in networked systems, e.g., IoT systems and 5G networks. Anomaly detection in MTS refers to identifying time series which exhibit different behaviors from normal status. Building such a system, however, is challenging due to a few reasons: i) labels for anomaly cases are usually unavailable or very rare; ii) most existing approaches rely on manual model-design and hyperparameter tuning, which may cost a huge amount of labor effort. To this end, we propose an autonomous anomaly detection technique for multivariate time series data (TimeAutoAD) based on a novel self-supervised contrastive loss. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst present an automatic anomaly detection pipeline to optimize the model conﬁguration and hyperparameters automatically. Next, we introduce three different strategies to augment the training data for generating pseudo negative time series and employ a self-supervised contrastive loss to distinguish the original time series and the generated time series. In this way, the representation learning capability of TimeAutoAD can be greatly enhanced and the anomaly detection performance can thus be improved. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed TimeAutoAD not only outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches but also exhibits robustness when training data are contaminated.},

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method for anomaly detection in time series data, called CL-TAD (Contrastive-Learning-based method for Times series Anomaly Detection), which employs a contrastive-learning-based representation learning technique. Inspired by the successes of reconstruction-based approaches and contrastive learning approaches, the proposed method seeks to leverage these approaches for time series anomaly detection. The CL-TAD method is comprised of two main components: positive sample generation and contrastivelearning-based representation learning. The former component generates positive samples by trying to reconstruct the original data from masked samples. These positive samples, in conjunction with the original data, serve as input for the contrastive-learning-based representation learning component. The representations of input original data and their masked data are used to detect anomalies later on. Experimental results have demonstrated that the CL-TAD method achieved the best performance on ﬁve datasets out of nine benchmark datasets over 10 other recent methods. By leveraging the reconstruction learning and contrastive learning techniques, our method offers a promising solution for effectively detecting anomalies in time series data by handling the issues raised by label scarcity and data diversity, delivering high performance.},

However, due to the complex temporal dependence and stochasticity of multivariate time series, their anomaly detection remains a big challenge. This paper proposes OmniAnomaly, a stochastic recurrent neural network for multivariate time series anomaly detection that works well robustly for various devices. Its core idea is to capture the normal patterns of multivariate time series by learning their robust representations with key techniques such as stochastic variable connection and planar normalizing flow, reconstruct input data by the representations, and use the reconstruction probabilities to determine anomalies. Moreover, for a detected entity anomaly, OmniAnomaly can provide interpretations based on the reconstruction probabilities of its constituent univariate time series. The evaluation experiments are conducted on two public datasets from aerospace and a new server machine dataset (collected and released by us) from an Internet company. OmniAnomaly achieves an overall F1-Score of 0.86 in three real-world datasets, significantly outperforming the best performing baseline method by 0.09. The interpretation accuracy for OmniAnomaly is up to 0.89.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection in multi-variate time series (MVTS) data is a huge challenge as it requires simultaneous representation of long term temporal dependencies and correlations across multiple variables. More often, this is solved by breaking the complexity through modeling one dependency at a time. In this paper, we propose a Time-series Representational Learning through Contrastive Predictive Coding (TRL-CPC) towards anomaly detection in MVTS data. First, we jointly optimize an encoder, an auto-regressor and a non-linear transformation function to effectively learn the representations of the MVTS data sets, for predicting future trends. It must be noted that the context vectors are representative of the observation window in the MTVS. Next, the latent representations for the succeeding instants obtained through non-linear transformations of these context vectors, are contrasted with the latent representations of the encoder for the multi-variables such that the density for the positive pair is maximized. Thus, the TRL-CPC helps to model the temporal dependencies and the correlations of the parameters for a healthy signal pattern. Finally, ﬁtting the latent representations are ﬁt into a Gaussian scoring function to detect anomalies. Evaluation of the proposed TRL-CPC on three MVTS data sets against SOTA anomaly detection methods shows the superiority of TRL-CPC.},

In this article, we propose a two-level hierarchical latent space representation that distills inliers’ feature descriptors [through autoencoders (AEs)] into more robust representations based on a variational family of distributions (through a variational AE) for zero-shot anomaly generation. From the learned latent distributions, we select those that lie on the outskirts of the training data as synthetic-outlier generators. Also, we synthesize from them, i.e., generate negative samples without seen them before, to train binary classiﬁers. We found that the use of the proposed hierarchical structure for feature distillation and fusion creates robust and general representations that allow us to synthesize pseudo outlier samples. Also, in turn, train robust binary classiﬁers for true outlier detection (without the need for actual outliers during training). We demonstrate the performance of our proposal on several benchmarks for anomaly detection.},

Recently, Transformers have shown great power in uniﬁed modeling of pointwise representation and pairwise association, and we ﬁnd that the self-attention weight distribution of each time point can embody rich association with the whole series. Our key observation is that due to the rarity of anomalies, it is extremely difﬁcult to build nontrivial associations from abnormal points to the whole series, thereby, the anomalies’ associations shall mainly concentrate on their adjacent time points. This adjacent-concentration bias implies an association-based criterion inherently distinguishable between normal and abnormal points, which we highlight through the Association Discrepancy. Technically, we propose the Anomaly Transformer with a new Anomaly-Attention mechanism to compute the association discrepancy. A minimax strategy is devised to amplify the normal-abnormal distinguishability of the association discrepancy. The Anomaly Transformer achieves state-of-theart results on six unsupervised time series anomaly detection benchmarks of three applications: service monitoring, space \& earth exploration, and water treatment.},

	abstract = {One main challenge in time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is the lack of labelled data in many real-life scenarios. Most of the existing anomaly detection methods focus on learning the normal behaviour of unlabelled time series in an unsupervised manner. The normal boundary is often defined tightly, resulting in slight deviations being classified as anomalies, consequently leading to a high false positive rate and a limited ability to generalise normal patterns. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end self-supervised ContrAstive Representation Learning approach for time series Anomaly detection (CARLA). While existing contrastive learning methods assume that augmented time series windows are positive samples and temporally distant windows are negative samples, we argue that these assumptions are limited as augmentation of time series can transform them to negative samples, and a temporally distant window can represent a positive sample. Our contrastive approach leverages existing generic knowledge about time series anomalies and injects various types of anomalies as negative samples. Therefore, CARLA not only learns normal behaviour but also learns deviations indicating anomalies. It creates similar representations for temporally closed windows and distinct ones for anomalies. Additionally, it leverages the information about representations' neighbours through a self-supervised approach to classify windows based on their nearest/furthest neighbours to further enhance the performance of anomaly detection. In extensive tests on seven major real-world time series anomaly detection datasets, CARLA shows superior performance over state-of-the-art self-supervised and unsupervised TSAD methods. Our research shows the potential of contrastive representation learning to advance time series anomaly detection.},

More precisely, we introduce a VAE model with a Gaussian Random Field (GRF) prior, namely VAE-GRF, which generalizes the classical VAE model. We show that, under some assumptions, the VAE-GRF largely outperforms the traditional VAE and some other probabilistic models developed for AD. Our experimental results suggest that the VAE-GRF could be used as a relevant VAE baseline in place of the traditional VAE with very limited additional computational cost.

	abstract = {Anomaly Detection (AD) is an important research topic, with very diverse applications such as industrial defect detection, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, intrusion detection, etc. Within the last few years, deep learning-based methods have become the standard approach for AD. In many practical cases, the anomalies are unknown in advance. Therefore, most of challenging AD problems need to be addressed in an unsupervised or weakly supervised framework. In this context, deep generative models are widely used, in particular Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. VAEs have been extended to Vector-Quantized VAEs (VQ-VAEs), a model increasingly popular because of its versatility enabled by the discrete latent space. We present for the first time a robust approach which takes advantage of the inner metrics of VQ-VAEs for AD. We show that the distance between the output of the encoder and the codebook vectors of a VQ-VAE provides a valuable information which can be used to localize the anomalies. In our approach, this metric complements a reconstruction-based metric to improve AD results. We compare our model with state-of-the-art AD models on three standards datasets, including the MVTec, UCSD-Ped1 and CIFAR-10 datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method yields high competitive results.},

To achieve this, we deﬁne the notion of a semantic output code classiﬁer (SOC) which utilizes a knowledge base of semantic properties of Y to extrapolate to novel classes. We provide a formalism for this type of classiﬁer and study its theoretical properties in a PAC framework, showing conditions under which the classiﬁer can accurately predict novel classes. As a case study, we build a SOC classiﬁer for a neural decoding task and show that it can often predict words that people are thinking about from functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) of their neural activity, even without training examples for those words.},

In our zero-shot framework distributional information in language can be seen as spanning a semantic basis for understanding what objects look like. Most previous zero-shot learning models can only differentiate between unseen classes. In contrast, our model can both obtain state of the art performance on classes that have thousands of training images and obtain reasonable performance on unseen classes. This is achieved by ﬁrst using outlier detection in the semantic space and then two separate recognition models. Furthermore, our model does not require any manually deﬁned semantic features for either words or images.},

In these contexts, the representations extracted by neural networks on available labeled timeseries data can reﬂect system states. However, this endeavor remains challenging due to the necessity of labeled data. Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) is one of the effective approaches to deal with this challenge, but existing SSCL-based models suffer from sampling bias and representation bias problems. This article introduces a debiased contrastive learning framework for time-series data and applies it to industrial fault detection tasks. This framework ﬁrst develops the multigranularity augmented view generation method to generate augmented views at different granularities. It then introduces the momentum clustering contrastive learning strategy and the expert knowledge guidance mechanism to mitigate sampling bias and representation bias, respectively. Finally, the experiments on a public bearing fault detection dataset and a widely used valve stiction detection dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed feature learning framework.},

We propose an approach, zero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), which uses paired dual-domain task-irrelevant data to eliminate the need for task-relevant target-domain training data. ZDDA learns to generate common representations for source and target domains data. Then, either domain representation is used later to train a system that works on both domains or having the ability to eliminate the need to either domain in sensor fusion settings. Two variants of ZDDA have been developed: ZDDA for classiﬁcation task (ZDDA-C) and ZDDA for metric learning task (ZDDAML). Another limitation in Existing approaches is that most of them are designed for the closed-set classiﬁcation task, i.e., the sets of classes in both the source and target domains are “known.” However, ZDDA-C is also applicable to the open-set classiﬁcation task where not all classes are “known” during training. Moreover, the effectiveness of ZDDA-ML shows ZDDA’s applicability is not limited to classiﬁcation tasks. ZDDA-C and ZDDA-ML are tested on classiﬁcation and metric-learning tasks, respectively. Under most experimental conditions, ZDDA outperforms the baseline without using task-relevant target-domain-training data.},
