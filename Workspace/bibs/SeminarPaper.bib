	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

	abstract = {Typically, renewable-power-generation forecasting using machine learning involves creating separate models for each photovoltaic or wind park, known as single-task learning models. However, transfer learning has gained popularity in recent years, as it allows for the transfer of knowledge from source parks to target parks. Nevertheless, determining the most similar source park(s) for transfer learning can be challenging, particularly when the target park has limited or no historical data samples. To address this issue, we propose a multi-task learning architecture that employs a Uniﬁed Autoencoder (UAE) to initially learn a common representation of input weather features among tasks and then utilizes a Task-Embedding layer in a Neural Network (TENN) to learn task-speciﬁc information. This proposed UAE-TENN architecture can be easily extended to new parks with or without historical data. We evaluate the performance of our proposed architecture and compare it to single-task learning models on six photovoltaic and wind farm datasets consisting of a total of 529 parks. Our results show that the UAE-TENN architecture signiﬁcantly improves power-forecasting performance by 10 to 19\% for photovoltaic parks and 5 to 15\% for wind parks compared to baseline models. We also demonstrate that UAE-TENN improves forecast accuracy for a new park by 19\% for photovoltaic parks, even in a zero-shot learning scenario where there is no historical data. Additionally, we propose variants of the Uniﬁed Autoencoder with convolutional and LSTM layers, compare their performance, and provide a comparison among architectures with different numbers of task-embedding dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of trained task embeddings for interpretation and visualization purposes.},

	abstract = {Transfer learning (TL), the next frontier in machine learning (ML), has gained much popularity in recent years, due to the various challenges faced in ML, like the requirement of vast amounts of training data, expensive and time-consuming labelling processes for data samples, and long training duration for models. TL is useful in tackling these problems, as it focuses on transferring knowledge from previously solved tasks to new tasks. Digital twins and other intelligent systems need to utilise TL to use the previously gained knowledge and solve new tasks in a more self-reliant way, and to incrementally increase their knowledge base. Therefore, in this article, the critical challenges in power forecasting and anomaly detection in the context of renewable energy systems are identiﬁed, and a potential TL framework to meet these challenges is proposed. This article also proposes a feature embedding approach to handle the missing sensors data. The proposed TL methods help to make a system more autonomous in the context of organic computing.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in diverse realworld applications such as cybersecurity, fault detection, network monitoring, predictive maintenance, and highly automated driving. However, obtaining labeled anomalous data can be a formidable challenge, especially when anomalies exhibit temporal evolution. This paper introduces LATAM (Long short-term memory Autoencoder with Temporal Attention Mechanism) for few-shot anomaly detection, with the aim of enhancing detection performance in scenarios with limited labeled anomaly data. LATAM effectively captures temporal dependencies and emphasizes signiﬁcant patterns in multivariate time series data. In our investigation, we comprehensively evaluate LATAM against other anomaly detection models, particularly assessing its capability in few-shot learning scenarios where we have minimal examples from the normal class and none from the anomalous class in the training data. Our experimental results, derived from real-world photovoltaic inverter data, highlight LATAM’s superiority, showcasing a substantial 27\% mean F1 score improvement, even when trained on a mere two-week dataset. Furthermore, LATAM demonstrates remarkable results on the open-source SWaT dataset, achieving a 12\% boost in accuracy with only two days of training data. Moreover, we introduce a simple yet effective dynamic thresholding mechanism, further enhancing the anomaly detection capabilities of LATAM. This underscores LATAM’s efﬁcacy in addressing the challenges posed by limited labeled anomalies in practical scenarios and it proves valuable for downstream tasks involving temporal representation and time series prediction, extending its utility beyond anomaly detection applications.},

	abstract = {Domain Adaptation aims at adapting the knowledge learned from a domain (source-domain) to another (target-domain). Existing approaches typically require a portion of task-relevant target-domain data a priori. We propose an approach, zero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), which uses paired dual-domain task-irrelevant data to eliminate the need for task-relevant target-domain training data. ZDDA learns to generate common representations for source and target domains data. Then, either domain representation is used later to train a system that works on both domains or having the ability to eliminate the need to either domain in sensor fusion settings. Two variants of ZDDA have been developed: ZDDA for classiﬁcation task (ZDDA-C) and ZDDA for metric learning task (ZDDAML). Another limitation in Existing approaches is that most of them are designed for the closed-set classiﬁcation task, i.e., the sets of classes in both the source and target domains are “known.” However, ZDDA-C is also applicable to the open-set classiﬁcation task where not all classes are “known” during training. Moreover, the effectiveness of ZDDA-ML shows ZDDA’s applicability is not limited to classiﬁcation tasks. ZDDA-C and ZDDA-ML are tested on classiﬁcation and metric-learning tasks, respectively. Under most experimental conditions, ZDDA outperforms the baseline without using task-relevant target-domain-training data.},

In order to improve the performance of learning tasks further, MTL can be combined with other learning paradigms including semi-supervised learning, active learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, multi-view learning and graphical models. When the number of tasks is large or the data dimensionality is high, we review online, parallel and distributed MTL models as well as dimensionality reduction and feature hashing to reveal their computational and storage advantages.

This article introduces a debiased contrastive learning framework for time-series data and applies it to industrial fault detection tasks. This framework ﬁrst develops the multigranularity augmented view generation method to generate augmented views at different granularities. It then introduces the momentum clustering contrastive learning strategy and the expert knowledge guidance mechanism to mitigate sampling bias and representation bias, respectively.

We provide a formalism for this type of classiﬁer and study its theoretical properties in a PAC framework, showing conditions under which the classiﬁer can accurately predict novel classes. As a case study, we build a SOC classiﬁer for a neural decoding task and show that it can often predict words that people are thinking about from functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) of their neural activity, even without training examples for those words.},

More precisely, we introduce a VAE model with a Gaussian Random Field (GRF) prior, namely VAE-GRF, which generalizes the classical VAE model. We show that, under some assumptions, the VAE-GRF largely outperforms the traditional VAE and some other probabilistic models developed for AD. Our experimental results suggest that the VAE-GRF could be used as a relevant VAE baseline in place of the traditional VAE with very limited additional computational cost. We provide competitive results on the public MVTec benchmark dataset for visual inspection, as well as on the public Livestock dataset dedicated to the task of unsupervised animal detection from aerial images.},

	abstract = {Anomaly Detection (AD) is an important research topic, with very diverse applications such as industrial defect detection, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, intrusion detection, etc. Within the last few years, deep learning-based methods have become the standard approach for AD. In many practical cases, the anomalies are unknown in advance. Therefore, most of challenging AD problems need to be addressed in an unsupervised or weakly supervised framework. In this context, deep generative models are widely used, in particular Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. VAEs have been extended to Vector-Quantized VAEs (VQ-VAEs), a model increasingly popular because of its versatility enabled by the discrete latent space. We present for the first time a robust approach which takes advantage of the inner metrics of VQ-VAEs for AD. We show that the distance between the output of the encoder and the codebook vectors of a VQ-VAE provides a valuable information which can be used to localize the anomalies. In our approach, this metric complements a reconstruction-based metric to improve AD results. We compare our model with state-of-the-art AD models on three standards datasets, including the MVTec, UCSD-Ped1 and CIFAR-10 datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method yields high competitive results.},

	abstract = {One main challenge in time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is the lack of labelled data in many real-life scenarios. Most of the existing anomaly detection methods focus on learning the normal behaviour of unlabelled time series in an unsupervised manner. The normal boundary is often defined tightly, resulting in slight deviations being classified as anomalies, consequently leading to a high false positive rate and a limited ability to generalise normal patterns. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end self-supervised ContrAstive Representation Learning approach for time series Anomaly detection (CARLA). While existing contrastive learning methods assume that augmented time series windows are positive samples and temporally distant windows are negative samples, we argue that these assumptions are limited as augmentation of time series can transform them to negative samples, and a temporally distant window can represent a positive sample. Our contrastive approach leverages existing generic knowledge about time series anomalies and injects various types of anomalies as negative samples. Therefore, CARLA not only learns normal behaviour but also learns deviations indicating anomalies. It creates similar representations for temporally closed windows and distinct ones for anomalies. Additionally, it leverages the information about representations' neighbours through a self-supervised approach to classify windows based on their nearest/furthest neighbours to further enhance the performance of anomaly detection. In extensive tests on seven major real-world time series anomaly detection datasets, CARLA shows superior performance over state-of-the-art self-supervised and unsupervised TSAD methods. Our research shows the potential of contrastive representation learning to advance time series anomaly detection.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised detection of anomaly points in time series is a challenging problem, which requires the model to derive a distinguishable criterion. Previous methods tackle the problem mainly through learning pointwise representation or pairwise association, however, neither is sufﬁcient to reason about the intricate dynamics. Recently, Transformers have shown great power in uniﬁed modeling of pointwise representation and pairwise association, and we ﬁnd that the self-attention weight distribution of each time point can embody rich association with the whole series. Our key observation is that due to the rarity of anomalies, it is extremely difﬁcult to build nontrivial associations from abnormal points to the whole series, thereby, the anomalies’ associations shall mainly concentrate on their adjacent time points. This adjacent-concentration bias implies an association-based criterion inherently distinguishable between normal and abnormal points, which we highlight through the Association Discrepancy. Technically, we propose the Anomaly Transformer with a new Anomaly-Attention mechanism to compute the association discrepancy. A minimax strategy is devised to amplify the normal-abnormal distinguishability of the association discrepancy. The Anomaly Transformer achieves state-of-theart results on six unsupervised time series anomaly detection benchmarks of three applications: service monitoring, space \& earth exploration, and water treatment.},

Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pretraining. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and taskspecific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pretrained time series models.

From the learned latent distributions, we select those that lie on the outskirts of the training data as synthetic-outlier generators. Also, we synthesize from them, i.e., generate negative samples without seen them before, to train binary classiﬁers. We found that the use of the proposed hierarchical structure for feature distillation and fusion creates robust and general representations that allow us to synthesize pseudo outlier samples. Also, in turn, train robust binary classiﬁers for true outlier detection (without the need for actual outliers during training).

	abstract = {Anomaly detection in multi-variate time series (MVTS) data is a huge challenge as it requires simultaneous representation of long term temporal dependencies and correlations across multiple variables. More often, this is solved by breaking the complexity through modeling one dependency at a time. In this paper, we propose a Time-series Representational Learning through Contrastive Predictive Coding (TRL-CPC) towards anomaly detection in MVTS data. First, we jointly optimize an encoder, an auto-regressor and a non-linear transformation function to effectively learn the representations of the MVTS data sets, for predicting future trends. It must be noted that the context vectors are representative of the observation window in the MTVS. Next, the latent representations for the succeeding instants obtained through non-linear transformations of these context vectors, are contrasted with the latent representations of the encoder for the multi-variables such that the density for the positive pair is maximized. Thus, the TRL-CPC helps to model the temporal dependencies and the correlations of the parameters for a healthy signal pattern. Finally, ﬁtting the latent representations are ﬁt into a Gaussian scoring function to detect anomalies. Evaluation of the proposed TRL-CPC on three MVTS data sets against SOTA anomaly detection methods shows the superiority of TRL-CPC.},

However, due to the complex temporal dependence and stochasticity of multivariate time series, their anomaly detection remains a big challenge. This paper proposes OmniAnomaly, a stochastic recurrent neural network for multivariate time series anomaly detection that works well robustly for various devices. Its core idea is to capture the normal patterns of multivariate time series by learning their robust representations with key techniques such as stochastic variable connection and planar normalizing flow, reconstruct input data by the representations, and use the reconstruction probabilities to determine anomalies. Moreover, for a detected entity anomaly, OmniAnomaly can provide interpretations based on the reconstruction probabilities of its constituent univariate time series. The evaluation experiments are conducted on two public datasets from aerospace and a new server machine dataset (collected and released by us) from an Internet company. OmniAnomaly achieves an overall F1-Score of 0.86 in three real-world datasets, significantly outperforming the best performing baseline method by 0.09. The interpretation accuracy for OmniAnomaly is up to 0.89.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection has gained increasing attention in recent years, but detecting anomalies in time series data remains challenging due to temporal dynamics, label scarcity, and data diversity in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method for anomaly detection in time series data, called CL-TAD (Contrastive-Learning-based method for Times series Anomaly Detection), which employs a contrastive-learning-based representation learning technique. Inspired by the successes of reconstruction-based approaches and contrastive learning approaches, the proposed method seeks to leverage these approaches for time series anomaly detection. The CL-TAD method is comprised of two main components: positive sample generation and contrastivelearning-based representation learning. The former component generates positive samples by trying to reconstruct the original data from masked samples. These positive samples, in conjunction with the original data, serve as input for the contrastive-learning-based representation learning component. The representations of input original data and their masked data are used to detect anomalies later on. Experimental results have demonstrated that the CL-TAD method achieved the best performance on ﬁve datasets out of nine benchmark datasets over 10 other recent methods. By leveraging the reconstruction learning and contrastive learning techniques, our method offers a promising solution for effectively detecting anomalies in time series data by handling the issues raised by label scarcity and data diversity, delivering high performance.},

	abstract = {Multivariate time series (MTS) data are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in networked systems, e.g., IoT systems and 5G networks. Anomaly detection in MTS refers to identifying time series which exhibit different behaviors from normal status. Building such a system, however, is challenging due to a few reasons: i) labels for anomaly cases are usually unavailable or very rare; ii) most existing approaches rely on manual model-design and hyperparameter tuning, which may cost a huge amount of labor effort. To this end, we propose an autonomous anomaly detection technique for multivariate time series data (TimeAutoAD) based on a novel self-supervised contrastive loss. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst present an automatic anomaly detection pipeline to optimize the model conﬁguration and hyperparameters automatically. Next, we introduce three different strategies to augment the training data for generating pseudo negative time series and employ a self-supervised contrastive loss to distinguish the original time series and the generated time series. In this way, the representation learning capability of TimeAutoAD can be greatly enhanced and the anomaly detection performance can thus be improved. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed TimeAutoAD not only outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches but also exhibits robustness when training data are contaminated.},

	abstract = {Research on unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) has recently progressed, significantly increasing detection accuracy. This paper focuses on texture images and considers how few normal samples are needed for accurate AD. We first highlight the critical nature of the problem that previous studies have overlooked: accurate detection gets harder for anisotropic textures when image orientations are not aligned between inputs and normal samples. We then propose a zero-shot method, which detects anomalies without using a normal sample. The method is free from the issue of unaligned orientation between input and normal images. It assumes the input texture to be homogeneous, detecting image regions that break the homogeneity as anomalies. We present a quantitative criterion to judge whether this assumption holds for an input texture. Experimental results show the broad applicability of the proposed zero-shot method and its good performance comparable to or even higher than the state-of-the-art methods using hundreds of normal samples.

	abstract = {Anomaly detection requires detecting abnormal samples in large unlabeled datasets. While progress in deep learning and the advent of foundation models has produced powerful zero-shot anomaly detection methods, their deployment in practice is often hindered by the lack of labeled data—without it, their detection performance cannot be evaluated reliably. In this work, we propose SWSA (Selection With Synthetic Anomalies): a general-purpose framework to select image-based anomaly detectors with a generated synthetic validation set. Our proposed anomaly generation method assumes access to only a small support set of normal images and requires no training or finetuning. Once generated, our synthetic validation set is used to create detection tasks that compose a validation framework for model selection. In an empirical study, we find that SWSA often selects models that match selections made with a groundtruth validation set, resulting in higher AUROCs than baseline methods. We also find that SWSA selects prompts for CLIP-based anomaly detection that outperform baseline prompt selection strategies on all datasets, including the challenging MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.},

	abstract = {This paper presents TS2Vec, a universal framework for learning representations of time series in an arbitrary semantic level. Unlike existing methods, TS2Vec performs contrastive learning in a hierarchical way over augmented context views, which enables a robust contextual representation for each timestamp. Furthermore, to obtain the representation of an arbitrary sub-sequence in the time series, we can apply a simple aggregation over the representations of corresponding timestamps. We conduct extensive experiments on time series classiﬁcation tasks to evaluate the quality of time series representations. As a result, TS2Vec achieves signiﬁcant improvement over existing SOTAs of unsupervised time series representation on 125 UCR datasets and 29 UEA datasets. The learned timestamp-level representations also achieve superior results in time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. A linear regression trained on top of the learned representations outperforms previous SOTAs of time series forecasting. Furthermore, we present a simple way to apply the learned representations for unsupervised anomaly detection, which establishes SOTA results in the literature.

Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4.
Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews.

	abstract = {Efficient anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate timeseries data is of great importance for modern industrial applications. However, building a system that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations is a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data volatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications. Despite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly detection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this paper, we propose TranAD, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection and diagnosis model which uses attentionbased sequence encoders to swiftly perform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the data. TranAD uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust multi-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability. Additionally, model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) allows us to train the model using limited data. Extensive empirical studies on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that TranAD can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods in detection and diagnosis performance with data and time-efficient training. Specifically, TranAD increases F1 scores by up to 17\%, reducing training times by up to 99\% compared to the baselines.},

Due to the intricate temporal dependencies within time series data and the difficulty in obtaining labeled data, recent anomaly detection methods have primarily focused on the temporal domain features of time series data, neglecting the frequency domain features. However, spectral analysis can better utilize periodic information within time series data such as seasonal patterns, which helps capturing multiscale and multiple frequency features. In this paper, we present a Fourier Time Series Transformer model (FTST for short), which combines the features of both time and frequency domains for time series anomaly detection. Specifically, the attention mechanism is utilized for modeling the temporal domain, while the Fourier Transform is employed to transform time series data into frequency domain data. The frequency domain features are then modeled using a Temporal Convolutional Network. By making full use of the temporal and frequency domains of time series data, FTST can significantly enhance the performance of time series anomaly detection.

However, the growing scale of signals, both in volumes and dimensions, overpowers traditional statistical state-space or supervised learning tools. Thus, state-of-the-art methods based on unsupervised deep learning are sought in recent research. However, we experienced flaws when implementing those methods, such as requiring partial supervision and weaknesses to high dimensional datasets, among other reasons discussed in this paper. We propose a practical approach for inferring anomalies from large multivariate sets. We observe an abundance of time series in real-world applications, which exhibit asynchronous and consistent repetitive variations, such as IT, weather, utility, and transportation. Our solution is designed to leverage this behavior. The solution utilizes spectral analysis on the latent representation of a pre-trained autoencoder to extract dominant frequencies across the signals, which are then used in a subsequent network that learns the phase shifts across the signals and produces a synchronized representation of the raw multivariate. Random subsets of the synchronous multivariate are then fed into an array of autoencoders learning to minimize the quantile reconstruction losses, which are then used to infer and localize anomalies based on a majority vote. We benchmark this method against state-of-the-art approaches on public datasets and eBay’s data using their referenced evaluation methods. Furthermore, we address the limitations of the referenced evaluation methods and propose a more realistic evaluation method.},

	abstract = {The UCR Time Series Archive - introduced in 2002, has become an important resource in the time series data mining community, with at least one thousand published papers making use of at least one data set from the archive. The original incarnation of the archive had sixteen data sets but since that time, it has gone through periodic expansions. The last expansion took place in the summer of 2015 when the archive grew from 45 to 85 data sets. This paper introduces and will focus on the new data expansion from 85 to 128 data sets. Beyond expanding this valuable resource, this paper offers pragmatic advice to anyone who may wish to evaluate a new algorithm on the archive. Finally, this paper makes a novel and yet actionable claim: of the hundreds of papers that show an improvement over the standard baseline (1-nearest neighbor classiﬁcation), a large fraction may be mis-attributing the reasons for their improvement. Moreover, they may have been able to achieve the same improvement with a much simpler modiﬁcation, requiring just a single line of code.},

	abstract = {Multivariate time series data come as a collection of time series describing different aspects of a certain temporal phenomenon. Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.},

At present, the deep learning method based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) has emerged for time series anomaly detection. However, this method needs to ﬁnd the best mapping from real-time space to the latent space at the anomaly detection stage, which brings new errors and takes a long time. In this paper, we propose a long short-term memory-based variational autoencoder generation adversarial networks (LSTM-based VAE-GAN) method for time series anomaly detection, which eﬀectively solves the above problems. Our method jointly trains the encoder, the generator and the discriminator to take advantage of the mapping ability of the encoder and the discrimination ability of the discriminator simultaneously. The long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are used as the encoder, the generator and the discriminator. At the anomaly detection stage, anomalies are detected based on reconstruction diﬀerence and discrimination results.

	abstract = {In recent years, due to the frequent occurrence of network intrusions, more and more researchers have begun to focus on network intrusion detection. However, it is still a challenge to detect unknown attacks. Currently, there are two main methods of unknown attack detection: clustering and honeypot. But they still have unsolved problems such as difﬁculty in collecting unknown attack samples and failure to detect on time. Zero-Shot learning is proposed to deal with the problem in this article, which can recognize unknown attacks by learning the mapping relations between feature space and semantic space (such as attribute space). When the semantic descriptions of all attacks (including known and unknown attacks) are provided, the classiﬁer built by Zero-Shot learning can extract common semantic information among all attacks and construct connections between known and unknown attacks. The classiﬁer then utilizes the connections to classify unknown attacks although there are no samples for unknown attacks. In this article, we ﬁrst propose to use Zero-Shot learning to overcome the challenge of unknown attack detection and illustrate the feasibility of this method. Secondly, we then propose a novel method of Zero-Shot learning based on sparse autoencoder for unknown attack detection. This method maps the feature of known attacks to the semantic space, and restores the semantic space to the feature space by constrains of reconstruction error, and establishes the feature to semantic mapping, which is used to detect unknown attacks. Veriﬁcation tests have been carried out by using the public dataset NSL\_KDD. From the experiments conducted in this work, the results show that the average accuracy reaches 88.3\%, which performs better than other methods.},

This article presents a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of unsupervised and semisupervised deep-learning-based methods for anomaly detection and diagnosis on multivariate time series data from cyberphysical systems. Unlike previous works, we vary the model and post-processing of model errors, i.e., the scoring functions independently of each other, through a grid of ten models and four scoring functions, comparing these variants to state-of-the-art methods. In time-series anomaly detection, detecting anomalous events is more important than detecting individual anomalous time points. Through experiments, we ﬁnd that the existing evaluation metrics either do not take events into account or cannot distinguish between a good detector and trivial detectors, such as a random or an all-positive detector. We propose a new metric to overcome these drawbacks, namely, the composite F-score (Fc1), for evaluating time-series anomaly detection. Our study highlights that dynamic scoring functions work much better than static ones for multivariate time series anomaly detection, and the choice of scoring functions often matters more than the choice of the underlying model. We also ﬁnd that a simple, channel-wise model—the univariate fully connected auto-encoder, with the dynamic Gaussian scoring function emerges as a winning candidate for both anomaly detection and diagnosis, beating state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The study involves a comprehensive evaluation across three different datasets: MSL, SMAP, and SWaT. Each dataset poses unique challenges, allowing for a robust assessment of the models’ capabilities in varied contexts. The dimensionality reduction techniques examined include PCA, UMAP, Random Projection, and t-SNE, each offering distinct advantages in simplifying highdimensional data. Our findings reveal that dimensionality reduction not only aids in reducing computational complexity but also significantly enhances anomaly detection performance in certain scenarios. Moreover, a remarkable reduction in training times was observed, with reductions by approximately 300\% and 650\% when dimensionality was halved and minimized to the lowest dimensions, respectively. This efficiency gain underscores the dual benefit of dimensionality reduction in both performance enhancement and operational efficiency. The MUTANT model exhibits notable adaptability, especially with UMAP reduction, while the Anomaly-Transformer demonstrates versatility across various reduction techniques. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the synergistic effects of dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection, contributing valuable perspectives to the field of time series analysis. The study underscores the importance of selecting appropriate dimensionality reduction strategies based on specific model requirements and dataset characteristics, paving the way for more efficient, accurate, and scalable solutions in anomaly detection.},

	abstract = {Real-time lightweight time series anomaly detection has become increasingly crucial in cybersecurity and many other domains. Its ability to adapt to unforeseen pattern changes and swiftly identify anomalies enables prompt responses and critical decision-making. While several such anomaly detection approaches have been introduced in recent years, they primarily utilize a single type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and have been implemented in only one deep learning framework. It is unclear how the use of different types of RNNs available in various deep learning frameworks affects the performance of these anomaly detection approaches due to the absence of comprehensive evaluations. Arbitrarily choosing a RNN variant and a deep learning framework to implement an anomaly detection approach may not reflect its true performance and could potentially mislead users into favoring one approach over another. In this paper, we aim to study the influence of various types of RNNs available in popular deep learning frameworks on real-time lightweight time series anomaly detection. We reviewed several state-of-the-art approaches and implemented a representative anomaly detection approach using well-known RNN variants supported by three widely recognized deep learning frameworks. A comprehensive evaluation is then conducted to analyze the performance of each implementation across real-world, open-source time series datasets. The evaluation results provide valuable guidance for selecting the appropriate RNN variant and deep learning framework for real-time, lightweight time series anomaly detection.},

Existing multi-normality-assumption-based methods are usually two-staged, ﬁrstly pre-training through certain tasks whose target may diﬀer from AD, limiting their performance. To overcome the shortcomings, a deep Contrastive One-Class Anomaly detection method of time series (COCA) is proposed by authors, following the normality assumptions of CL and one-class classiﬁcation. It treats the original and reconstructed representations as the positive pair of negative-sample-free CL, namely “sequence contrast”. Next, invariance terms and variance terms compose a contrastive one-class loss function in which the loss of the assumptions is optimized by invariance terms simultaneously and the “hypersphere collapse” is prevented by variance terms.

The most fundamental challenge for this task is to learn a representation map that enables effective discrimination of anomalies. Reconstruction-based methods still dominate, but the representation learning with anomalies might hurt the performance with its large abnormal loss. On the other hand, contrastive learning aims to find a representation that can clearly distinguish any instance from the others, which can bring a more natural and promising representation for time series anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose DCdetector, a multi-scale dual attention contrastive representation learning model. DCdetector utilizes a novel dual attention asymmetric design to create the permutated environment and pure contrastive loss to guide the learning process, thus learning a permutation invariant representation with superior discrimination abilities.

Most existing methods focus on learning the temporal patterns of the signals to detect anomalies. However, the performance is limited due to two critical problems. First, the relationships between different signals are rarely considered, resulting in missing important information for representation. Second, the high sensitivity of time series makes it difﬁcult to use conventional methods for data augmentation, which limits the improvement of representation and generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel reconstruction-based framework with contrastive learning from multiple views to address these two issues. Speciﬁcally, intrasignal and intersignal graph structures are formed and learned in parallel to model the temporal context and capture the dependency relationships between signals, respectively. Multiview graph contrastive learning strategy is designed to improve the graph representation. We also provide an adaptive data augmentation method to generate graph views for contrastive learning, which helps to accurately capture valuable intrinsic patterns from two different perspectives. Finally, the contrastive learning task and the reconstruction task are jointly trained. Extensive experiments on four real-world data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Detecting anomalies in temporal data is challenging due to anomalies being dependent on temporal dynamics. One-class classiﬁcation methods are commonly used for anomaly detection tasks, but they have limitations when applied to temporal data. In particular, mapping all normal instances into a single hypersphere to capture their global characteristics can lead to poor performance in detecting context-based anomalies where the abnormality is deﬁned with respect to local information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach inspired by the loss function of DeepSVDD. Instead of mapping all normal instances into a single hypersphere center, each normal instance is pulled toward a recent context window. However, this approach is prone to a representation collapse issue where the neural network that encodes a given instance and its context is optimized towards a constant encoder solution. To overcome this problem, we combine our approach with a deterministic contrastive loss from Neutral AD, a promising self-supervised learning anomaly detection approach. We provide a theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the incorporation of the deterministic contrastive loss can eﬀectively prevent the occurrence of a constant encoder solution. Experimental results show superior performance of our model over various baselines and model variants on real-world industrial datasets.},

	abstract = {The ongoing challenges in time series anomaly detection (TSAD), including the scarcity of anomaly labels and the variability in anomaly lengths and shapes, have led to the need for a more robust and efficient solution. As limited anomaly labels hinder traditional supervised models in anomaly detection, various state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning techniques (e.g., self-supervised learning) are introduced to tackle this issue. However, they encounter difficulties handling variations in anomaly lengths and shapes, limiting their adaptability to diverse anomalies. Additionally, many benchmark datasets suffer from the problem of having explicit anomalies that even random functions can detect. This problem is exacerbated by an illposed evaluation metric, known as point adjustment (PA), which results in inflated model performance. In this context, we propose a novel self-supervised learning based Tri-domain Anomaly Detector (TriAD), which addresses these challenges by modeling features across three aspects - temporal, frequency, and residual domains - without relying on anomaly labels. Unlike traditional contrastive learning methods, TriAD employs both inter-domain and intra-domain contrastive loss to learn common attributes among normal data and differentiate them from anomalies. Additionally, our approach can detect anomalies of varying lengths by integrating with a discord discovery algorithm. It is worth noting that this study is the first to reevaluate the deep learning potential in TSAD, utilizing both rigorously designed datasets (i.e., UCR Archive) and evaluation metrics (i.e., PA\%K and affiliation). Experimental results demonstrate that TriAD achieves an impressive three-fold increase in PA\%K based F1 scores over SOTA deep learning models. Moreover, in comparison to SOTA discord discovery algorithms, TriAD improves anomaly detection accuracy by 50\% while cutting the inference time down to just one-tenth. Illuminating the significance of rigorous datasets and evaluation metrics, this paper offers a new direction for addressing the multifaceted challenges of time series anomaly detection.
