# Implementations of chosen RL methods
## MOMENT
The file impl_moment.ipynb is an extension of the tutorial anomaly_detection.ipynb found in here: github.com/moment-timeseries-foundation-model/moment/blob/main/tutorials/anomaly\_detection.ipynb

The evaluation on the model is presented on inverter 0. According to the solution all other inverters are tested the same way.

## MEGA
The main_mutiwave.py script found in here github.com/jingwang2020/MEGA is used to evaluate on the SMA dataset.

## TS2Vec
